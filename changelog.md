# `CBF Detected, Loser!` Changelog
## v1.2.5
- Experimental iOS support.
## v1.2.4
- Tidy one last thing up. I promise this will be the latest update in a while.
## v1.2.3
- Port to 2.2074.
## v1.2.2
- Tidy a few more things up.
## v1.2.1
- Fix flickering behavior when `Hide Outside Of Levels` is enabled.
## v1.2.0
- Attempt to fix Z ordering issues within the level editor one more time.
  - If stuff still breaks at this point, I'm throwing in the towel.
## v1.1.2
- Set Z order to 10 and made it a setting because why not. (It used to be at Z order 109780665 because comedy, then I got too lazy to resolve mod conflicts, so now it's a setting.)
## v1.1.1
- Fix `Background Width` and `Scale` settings not applying properly between reboots.
## v1.1.0
- `"oh yeah uhh by the way i changed the cbf detected back to red"` <cl>- ItzKiba, Thursday, September 5th, 2024 at 10:32 PM EDT</c>
  - As a result, `Less Offensive Title Text` has now been split to individual color and text content settings. Given that this is a joke mod and only two settings need to be adjusted, settings will simply be reset.
## v1.0.2
- `Hide Outside Of Levels` is now enabled by default for future installs.
- Fix a grammar error from the previous changelogs.
## v1.0.1
- Rephrase a few things in `about.md`.
- `support.md` now contains Kiba's journey with the original CBF blocker, and why he added one to Nullscapes at all. This is specifically in case Pastebin.com admins do something silly and delete the original pastebin. <cy>(Some minor adjustments have been made to the pastebin, either for readability or to ensure this mod still follows Geode's anti-profanity guidelines.) [Yes, this was done with Kiba's permission.]</c>
- `Less Offensive Title Text` is now enabled by default for future installs. This is to better reflect the current CBF blocker in Nullscapes.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
