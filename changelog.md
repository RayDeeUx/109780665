# 1.0.2
- `Hide Outside Of Levels` is now enabled by default for future installs.
- Fix a grammar error from the previous changelogs.
# 1.0.1
- Rephrase a few things in `about.md`.
- `support.md` now contains Kiba's journey with the original CBF blocker, and why he added one to Nullscapes at all. This is specifically in case Pastebin.com admins do something silly and delete the original pastebin. <cy>(Some minor adjustments have been made to the pastebin, either for readability or to ensure this mod still follows Geode's anti-profanity guidelines.) [Yes, this was done with Kiba's permission.]</c>
- `Less Offensive Title Text` is now enabled by default for future installs. This is to better reflect the current CBF blocker in Nullscapes.
# 1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
